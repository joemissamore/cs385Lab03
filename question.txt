Verify the effect of creating a replicaset in the pods that are running. Also, what is the effect of scaling the service in the output of your service (e.i. when you curl your serviceâ€™s External IP Address)? Explain why you observe this behavior?

When performing multiple curls the service is distributed to one of the 3 running services. This is obvious because of the output you get when running multiple curl commands.
